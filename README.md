# Streamlit app to access Wikidata

This is a simple demo in Streamlit I did to see the diffrence between building an app with stramlit vs. shiny for python.

The app can be run with:

```
streamlit run app.py 
```

And while I tried to follow the same logic as for the shiny app and build it as a package, it seems that after:

```
pip install .
```

There is no way to run the app, or at least I can't figure out a way to do it.
